# 'Ruby 101' workshop

Material for a small workshop intended to get attendees started using Ruby for simple scripting tasks. Basic intro to syntax. Enough
practice to get a taste of the language. Learn enough to be able to create simple utility scripts.

The intended audience is software developers with Java and C# backgrounds, possibly with some dynamic language background.

One way to use this workshop:

* Go through slides and exercises one by one. 
* Timebox each exercise to 15 minutes.
* After 15 minutes are up, show people one possible solution to current exercise
* Onto the next slide and exercise...
