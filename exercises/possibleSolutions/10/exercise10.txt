Exercise 10 (filesystem)
--

Create a method recursive_xml_extension_to_txt(dir) which for a given directory finds 
all the *.xml files within all its subdirectiries, 
and for each of them renames them from *.xml to *.txt

CAUTION! Don't run this on the root dir of your harddrive!
	
	
BONUS: Turn it into a proper script. Send url and output file 
path as arguments to script. Exit with a friendly usage text if user supplies
wrong number of arguments. Also, write unit tests along the way. :)
