Exercise 2 (blocks, iterators)
--

Create a method that repeats a given string n times, with a comma between each instance. 
You're only allowed to type ONE print-statement ('puts') in your code.

Example: repeat("Hello world", 3) 	=>  "Hello world Hello world Hello world"
			
			
			
								
BONUS: Add count to each occurrence of the string.

Example: repeat("Hello world number", 3) 	=>  "Hello world number 1 Hello world number 2 Hello world number 3"
