Exercise 8 (regex)
--

Create a method count_word(word) which counts number of times 
the specified word occurs in the given text. 
Use the =~ operator or Regexp.match() to accomplish it.
	
Example: 	
	
SEARCHED_TEXT = <<TEXT
This is a line
This is another line
Third line coming up
TEXT	
	
count_word(SEARCHED_TEXT, "line")	=>  3
	
	
	
	
BONUS: Create a method word_occurs_at(word) 
Make the method handle a multiline string/document, 
return or print out the location (char position and line number) of each occurrence.

Example:

word_occurs_at(SEARCHED_TEXT, "line")  =>   [[10,1], [16,2], [6,3]]
