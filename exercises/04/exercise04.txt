Exercise 4 (strings)
--

Create a method dummy_text(line_width, line_no) that returns a "filler text" 
(lorem ipsum-style text or something other random) with line_no lines, line_width number of chars per line. 
It doesn't have to support many or long lines: maybe up to 10 lines with max 30 chars per line.

Example: dummy_text(20, 5)   =>		"Lorem ipsum dolor si\n
									 t amet, consectetur \n
									 adipisicing elit, se\n
									 do eiusmod tempor in\n
									 cididunt ut labore e\n"
									
									
									
BONUS: Create a similar method with an additional parameter: 
dummy_text_long(line_width, line_no, words)
The final parameter 'words' is an array of strings that the method pulls from at random to construct the dummy text. 
The method now has to support arbitrary numbers of characters per line and lines total.

Example: dummy_text_long(20, 300, ["jabba", "dabba", "doo"])   =>		"doo jabba doo jabba \n
										 								 jabba doo dabba jabb\n 
										 								 dabba jabba jabba do\n
										 								 <... etc (300 lines)>
