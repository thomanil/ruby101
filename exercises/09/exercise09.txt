Exercise 9 (shell integration)
--

Create a execute_in_shell(command) that simply executes the given command 
in your dos or unix shell, and returns the result as a string.

Example:
execute_in_shell("pwd")  => <prints current dir>	
	
	
	
BONUS: Create a method dir_contents(path) which lists the contents of
the given directory. Use the shell directly instead of the Dir api in Ruby.

Example:
dir_contents("/usr/local")  =>  <list of files and directories at /usr/local directory>.
